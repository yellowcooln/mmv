# Versions

## [0.7.1] – 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Packet animation now highlights nodes only (no moving inter-hop particles)
- Packet highlights continue to support fixed duration or packet-duration timing via Viz Settings
- Reduced packet highlight refresh cadence to lower render churn during active traffic
- Added packet observation window batching for highlight updates to coalesce bursts and reduce mobile animation jank
- Project naming updated to **MeshCore MQTT Visualiser** across UI and docs

### Docs
- Updated README project title and summary naming to MeshCore MQTT Visualiser
- Added this release entry to the changelog

## [0.7.0] – 2026-03-04

### Added
- Geographic layout influence: node lat/lng (from MeshCore advert packets) is now
  sent to the frontend and used to influence the force-directed graph layout
- Geo-seeded initial positions — new nodes are placed at their projected geographic
  coordinates rather than random scatter, giving the simulation a geographically
  informed starting point
- `forceX`/`forceY` geo-attraction forces pull located nodes gently toward their
  projected position; configurable via a **Geo influence** slider (0–0.3) in Viz
  Settings (only shown when at least one node has location data)
- `CENTER_LAT` / `CENTER_LON` env vars pin the geo projection to a fixed reference
  point instead of the computed centroid; useful when monitoring a known area so
  the layout stays stable as new edge nodes appear
- `GEO_ENABLED=false` env var disables all geographic positioning entirely —
  hides the slider, skips geo seeding, and restores pure topology-driven layout

### Changed
- Geo projection centre defaults to the **centroid** (mean lat/lng) of all located
  nodes rather than the bounding-box midpoint — a single outlier no longer skews
  the whole layout
- Debug button and panel removed from the UI

### Fixed
- Indentation inconsistency in `App.tsx` state declarations

## [0.6.0] – 2026-03-04

### Added
- Node search with focus-fly-to in both 2D and 3D modes
- Edge highlighting for selected node connections
- 3D orbit mode — camera orbits around the selected node
- Clear-selection chip when the node panel is closed (node stays selected)
- Optional packet deduplication toggle in viz settings
- Degree-weighted repulsion and bidirectional edge deduplication
- Node colouring by device role with configurable edge packet threshold
- `VITE_PORT` environment variable for configuring the Vite dev-server port (default 9001)
- Dynamic MQTT broker label in the stats bar
- Path length and hop duration included in WebSocket packet messages

### Changed
- Switched MQTT ingest topic from `/raw` to `/packets`
- 3D mesh refresh throttled to 30 s to reduce mobile CPU usage
- Viz Settings panel is now scrollable to accommodate all controls
- All 3D force parameters (link distance, strength, repulsion, label size, link opacity) now correctly wired to the simulation

### Fixed
- MQTT topic parsing edge cases
- Search result flash on node selection
- Path hash normalisation (lowercase) and DB query performance
- 3D warmup ticks and SpriteText label caching

---

## [0.5.0] – 2026-03-04

### Added
- Split 3D visualization controls into their own settings panel section
- Orbit mode and label visibility controls for 3D graph

### Changed
- 3D graph is now the default mode
- Directional arrows removed from graph edges
- Graph state stabilised — updates no longer cause layout jitter

### Fixed
- Graph viewport preserved across node/edge updates
- Path nodes no longer retyped as chat devices on subsequent packets
- Path hop normalization for 2-digit packet hops

---

## [0.4.0] – 2026-03-03

### Added
- Optional 3D force-directed graph mode using `react-force-graph-3d` + Three.js
- Role-based node colours (repeater, client, observer, etc.)
- Connection-based node sizing (degree-weighted)
- Graph visualization controls panel (link distance, strength, repulsion, node radius, labels)
- Observer nodes pre-populated from MQTT config topics

### Changed
- MQTT subscription broadened to `meshcore/#` then narrowed to `meshcore/MEL/+/packets`
- Replaced group-channel nodes with client diamond shapes
- Live packet animation on active edges

### Fixed
- Viewport preserved across node additions (no full re-render)
- Raw binary MQTT payloads handled correctly
- Path hashes normalised to lowercase on ingest

---

## [0.3.0] – 2026-03-02

### Added

- Servers bound to `0.0.0.0` for LAN/container access
- Vite dev server bound to all interfaces

### Changed
- MQTT topic changed to `meshcore/#`
- Switched from `better-sqlite3` to the built-in `node:sqlite` module

---

## [0.1.0] – 2026-03-02
